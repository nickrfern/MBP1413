# MBP1413
Code Repository for the final project of MBP1413H, March 2022. Written by Nicholas Fernandez and Yuan Chang


All training, validation and testing was run on the RIT-HPC compute cluster at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON. Scripts were completed using CPU resources with Xeon E5-2670 v2 and Xeon Gold 6140 cores and usage of GPU resources due to cluster access limitations. All jobs requested 1 node, 32 processors and a flexible amount of RAM as required by the specific method. Scripts were run in R version 4.1.2 and Python 3.8.1.
