Scripts for SVM model training and final prediction on test data. One script was run for each cross-fold and each hyperparameter during the validation phase so that parallel jobs could be submitted to the cluster. As such, the svm_cv.py script shown above was used in the modelling of the first cross fold with a linear kernel of training data.
