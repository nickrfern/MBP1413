Scripts for SVM model training and final prediction on test data. One script was run for each cross-fold and each hyperparameter during the validation phase so that parallel jobs could be submitted to the cluster. As such, the svm_cv.py script shown above was used in the modelling of the first cross fold of training data with a linear kernel. A radial basis function kernel was also tested on the training set (not shown).
